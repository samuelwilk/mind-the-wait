# Mind the Wait: Product Vision

**Mission:** Expose transit system reliability through transparent, real-time service quality metrics that empower riders, advocates, and city officials to make informed decisions and drive accountability.

## Core Value Proposition

Mind the Wait is **not** a Google Maps competitor for arrival predictions. It's a **transit transparency and advocacy platform** that surfaces reliability metrics invisible in consumer navigation apps.

### What Makes Us Different

**Google Maps tells you:** "Bus 27 arrives in 6 minutes"

**Mind the Wait tells you:**
- Route 27 has **D-grade headway** (buses bunching frequently)
- This bus has been **late 73% of the time** this week
- Route 14 to the same destination has **A-grade reliability**
- Riders report this bus is **systematically later** than agency predictions
- Two buses are about to arrive together, then **20-minute gap**

## Target Audiences

### 1. Daily Riders
**Need:** Make better transit decisions
**Features:** Route comparisons, reliability warnings, bunching alerts

### 2. Transit Advocates
**Need:** Data-driven evidence for policy change
**Features:** Historical reliability reports, route scorecards, export capabilities

### 3. City Officials / Transit Agencies
**Need:** Identify underperforming routes and measure improvements

## Killer Features (That Google Doesn't Have)

### 1. "Should I Wait or Walk?" Decision Engine

**Problem:** Rider at stop with 2 route options - which is more reliable?

**Solution:**
```
üö∂ Walk to Stop B (8 min)
  Route 14 ‚Üí A-grade reliability (89% on-time)
  Next arrival: 12 min

‚è±Ô∏è  Wait at Stop A
  Route 27 ‚Üí D-grade reliability (52% on-time)
  Next arrival: 3 min (‚ö†Ô∏è but historically 6 min late)

Recommendation: Walk to Stop B
Reason: Route 14 more reliable, you'll arrive 4 min sooner on average
```

**Inputs:**
- Current location
- Destination
- Nearby stops with route options
- Historical reliability scores
- Current predictions + historical delay patterns

**Output:**
- Clear recommendation with reasoning
- Expected arrival time accounting for reliability
- Confidence score

---

### 2. Route Reliability Comparison

**Problem:** Multiple routes go to same destination - which is most reliable?

**Solution:**
```
Route to University of Saskatchewan from Downtown

Route 27 (Silverspring)    Grade: D    52% on-time    Avg delay: 6.2 min
Route 14 (North Industrial) Grade: A    89% on-time    Avg delay: 1.1 min ‚≠ê BEST
Route 12 (River Heights)    Grade: C+   71% on-time    Avg delay: 3.4 min

üéØ Take Route 14 for most reliable service
üìä Based on 1,847 arrivals over last 30 days
```

**Features:**
- Side-by-side route comparison
- Historical on-time performance
- Average delay/early arrival
- Headway grade trends (past week/month)
- Peak vs off-peak reliability splits
- "Best time to ride" recommendations

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/route-comparison?from_stop=3734&to_stop=5201
```

---

### 3. Bunching Alerts

**Problem:** Agency says "3 min and 12 min" but buses will arrive together, then huge gap.

**Solution:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è BUNCHING ALERT: Route 27 Northbound

2 buses arriving together:
  ‚Ä¢ Bus 606: 3 min (on schedule)
  ‚Ä¢ Bus 707: 4 min (14 min ahead of schedule)

Then 24-minute gap until next bus

üí° Suggestion: Take first bus, next one won't be far behind schedule
```

**Detection Logic:**
- Multiple buses on same route within 2 minutes of each other
- Gap after bunched buses > 1.5√ó scheduled headway
- Alert riders via API/push notifications

**Use Cases:**
- Rider decides to wait for less crowded second bus
- Rider knows not to panic if they miss bunched buses
- Agency sees systemic bunching patterns by route/time

---

### 4. Service Quality Warnings

**Problem:** Bus says "on time" but this route is chronically unreliable at this hour.

**Solution:**
```
üöå Route 43 to City Centre
Arrival: 6:51 PM (predicted)

‚ö†Ô∏è RELIABILITY WARNING
This route is late 78% of the time on Friday evenings
Average delay: 8.3 minutes
Based on 156 arrivals

Plan for arrival around 7:00 PM instead
```

**Triggers:**
- Route has <60% on-time performance for this time/day combination
- Average delay >5 minutes
- Pattern consistent over 30+ observations

**Breakdown by:**
- Time of day (morning rush, midday, evening, night)
- Day of week
- Weather conditions (if available)
- Special events (if calendar integration)

---

### 5. Crowd Wisdom Override

**Problem:** Agency TripUpdate says "on time" but GPS shows bus stuck in traffic.

**Solution:**
```
üöå Bus 606 to University
Agency says: 6:51 PM arrival (on time)

üë• Crowd Feedback (last 20 riders):
   ‚Ä¢ Late: 17 votes (85%)
   ‚Ä¢ On time: 2 votes (10%)
   ‚Ä¢ Early: 1 vote (5%)

‚ö†Ô∏è Crowd consensus: Likely 5-10 min late
Consider alternative routes
```

**Features:**
- Real-time crowd feedback aggregation
- Flag predictions with >70% disagreement
- Show historical crowd accuracy
- "Was the crowd right?" post-arrival validation

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "prediction": {
    "agency_arrival": 1759897380,
    "crowd_consensus": "late",
    "crowd_confidence": 0.85,
    "suggested_arrival": 1759897680,
    "crowd_correction_sec": 300
  }
}
```

---

### 6. "Best Time to Catch This Bus"

**Problem:** Rider has flexible schedule - when is this route most reliable?

**Solution:**
```
üìä Route 27 Reliability by Hour (Weekdays)

üü¢ 7:00-9:00 AM   Grade: A-   92% on-time   Best window
üü° 9:00-12:00 PM  Grade: B    81% on-time
üü° 12:00-3:00 PM  Grade: B-   76% on-time
üü† 3:00-6:00 PM   Grade: D+   58% on-time   Avoid if possible
üü° 6:00-9:00 PM   Grade: C    68% on-time

- **Citymapper**: Multi-modal routing (some delay history)
- **Moovit**: Crowdsourcing (limited analytics)

### Our Niche
**Open-source transit transparency and advocacy platform**

- Only tool focused on *system reliability* vs *individual predictions*
- Open data for researchers and advocates
- Public accountability dashboard
- City-agnostic (deployable anywhere with GTFS)
