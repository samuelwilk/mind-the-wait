## üöß In Progress

### Stop-Level Reliability Improvements (Part 2/2)

**Remaining Tasks:**
1. Update RoutePerformanceService:
   - Build two separate charts (one per direction)
   - Add `getHeadsignForDirection()` helper method
   - Add `shortenStopName()` helper method
   - Generate direction labels (e.g., "City Centre ‚Üì", "North Industrial ‚Üë")

2. Update RouteDetailDto:
   - Replace single `stopReliabilityChart` with two properties:
     - `stopReliabilityChartDirection0` (outbound)
     - `stopReliabilityChartDirection1` (inbound)

3. Update route_detail.html.twig:
   - Display two charts side-by-side (grid layout)
   - Add direction arrows (‚Üì and ‚Üë) in titles
   - Update descriptions to explain route order

4. Update RoutePerformanceChartPreset:
   - Add direction parameter to `stopReliability()`
   - Include direction in chart title

5. Test:
   - Verify charts show correct data for each direction
   - Verify stops are sorted by sequence
   - Verify direction labels are accurate
   - Test mobile responsiveness

**Estimated Time:** 30-40 minutes

## üìã Deployment Requirements

### 1. Add GitHub Secret

**Action Required:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/samuelwilk/mind-the-wait/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`
4. Value: `G-LRK992JPE0`
5. Click "Add secret"

### 2. Update Terraform/ECS Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status:** GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID has been added to Terraform configuration.

**Changes made:**
- ‚úÖ Added `ga4_measurement_id` variable to `terraform/environments/prod/variables.tf`
- ‚úÖ Added GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID to PHP service environment variables
- ‚úÖ Added GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID to scheduler-high-freq service environment variables
- ‚úÖ Added GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID to scheduler-low-freq service environment variables
- ‚úÖ Added value to `terraform/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars`

**Files modified:**
- `terraform/environments/prod/main.tf` (lines 157, 255, 309)
- `terraform/environments/prod/variables.tf` (lines 142-146)
- `terraform/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars` (line 62)

### 3. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Option 1: If using GitHub Actions
# Push triggers automatic deployment via CI/CD

# Option 2: Manual deploy
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Verify deployment
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster mindthewait-prod
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster mindthewait-prod --tasks <task-arn>
```

### 4. Verify GA4 is Working

**Immediate Verification:**
1. Visit production site: https://mindthewait.ca
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
3. Type: `dataLayer`
4. Should see array with GA4 initialization

**Check Environment Variable:**
```bash
# SSH into ECS container or use ECS Exec
aws ecs execute-command \
  --cluster mindthewait-prod \
  --task <task-id> \
  --container app \
  --interactive \
  --command "env | grep GA4"

# Should output: GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-LRK992JPE0
```

**GA4 Dashboard (within 30 seconds):**
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Navigate to: Reports ‚Üí Realtime
3. Should see active users

**Test Cookie Consent Flow:**
1. Visit site in incognito mode
2. Cookie banner should appear at bottom
3. Click "Accept" ‚Üí banner disappears, localStorage has `analytics-consent=granted`
4. Click "Decline" ‚Üí banner disappears, localStorage has `analytics-consent=denied`
5. Refresh page ‚Üí banner should NOT reappear
