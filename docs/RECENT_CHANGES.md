## ðŸŽ¯ October 14, 2025 - Latest Changes

### 1. Route Detail Heatmap Implementation

**Problem**: The "Performance by Day & Time" chart on route detail pages was showing randomly generated placeholder data instead of real arrival log data.

**Solution**: Replaced hardcoded fake data with SQL query that pulls real data from the `arrival_log` table.

**Changes Made**:

#### Updated Files
- `src/Service/Dashboard/RoutePerformanceService.php:286-349` - Implemented real data query

**Implementation Details**:
```php
// Queries arrival_log table grouped by day of week and hour bucket
SELECT
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM predicted_at) as day_of_week,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM predicted_at) < 6  THEN 0
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM predicted_at) < 9  THEN 1
        // ... (7 hour buckets total)
    END as hour_bucket,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    SUM(CASE WHEN delay_sec BETWEEN -180 AND 180 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as on_time
FROM arrival_log
WHERE route_id = :route_id
    AND predicted_at >= :start_date
    AND predicted_at < :end_date
GROUP BY day_of_week, hour_bucket
```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… No more fake/random data in production
- âœ… Accurate performance visualization by time of day and day of week
- âœ… Gracefully handles empty data (shows gray cells with null values)
- âœ… Will auto-populate as arrival_log data accumulates
- âœ… On-time threshold: Â±3 minutes (consistent with system-wide standard)

---

### 2. Development Docker Build Fix

**Problem**: Docker build was failing with `"/docker/php.ini": not found` error.

**Solution**: Fixed incorrect file path in Dockerfile.

**Changes Made**:

#### Updated Files
- `docker/dev/Dockerfile:20` - Changed `COPY docker/php.ini` to `COPY docker/dev/php.ini`

**Impact**:
- âœ… `make docker-build` and `make docker-up` now work without errors
- âœ… Containers build successfully on fresh clones
- âœ… No disruption to existing running containers

---

### 3. Production Timezone Fix

**Issue**: Dashboard showed "last updated at 9:11:11 PM" on mobile, which was UTC time instead of local Saskatchewan time.

**Solution**: Already fixed in previous deployment (October 12) - timezone set to `America/Regina`.

**Status**:
- âœ… Fixed in `frankenphp/conf.d/10-app.ini:4`
- âœ… Deployed to production in v0.4.0
- âœ… All timestamps now show Saskatoon local time (CST/CDT)

---

## ðŸ”„ Deployment Notes

### What's New in This Deployment

1. **Route Detail Pages**:
   - Heatmap now shows real data (or empty gray cells if no data yet)
   - No more placeholder values of 65 Â± 10

2. **Development Setup**:
   - Dockerfile fixed for clean builds
   - No breaking changes

3. **Production**:
   - Timezone already deployed (working correctly)
   - Weather collection running hourly
   - All schedulers operational

### Data Collection Timeline

The heatmap will populate as arrival logging accumulates:
- **Day 1**: Empty (gray cells with null values)
- **After 1 day**: Sparse data for times with predictions
- **After 1 week**: Good coverage during peak hours
- **After 30 days**: Full heatmap with statistical significance

---

## âœ… Verification Checklist

After this deployment:

- [ ] Route detail page loads without errors
- [ ] Heatmap shows either real data or gray cells (not random numbers)
- [ ] Dashboard timestamps show Saskatoon local time
- [ ] Weather banner displays current conditions (if available)

## ðŸŽ¯ October 12, 2025 - Scheduler Refactor and Setup Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Improvements

### 1. Scheduler Architecture Refactor

**Problem**: The scheduler container was using a bash loop (`while true; do php bin/console app:score:tick; sleep 30; done`), which was a code smell and inconsistent with Symfony best practices.

**Solution**: Migrated to Symfony Scheduler with message-based architecture.

**Changes Made**:

#### New Files
- `src/Scheduler/ScoreTickSchedule.php` - Runs every 30 seconds
- `src/MessageHandler/ScoreTickMessageHandler.php` - Handles score calculation messages

#### Updated Files
- `compose.yaml:97` - Now runs `messenger:consume` instead of bash loop
  ```yaml
  command: php bin/console messenger:consume scheduler_score_tick scheduler_weather_collection scheduler_performance_aggregation -vv
  ```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Consistent with other scheduled tasks (weather, performance)
- âœ… Proper error handling and retry logic via Messenger
- âœ… Better logging through Symfony's messenger infrastructure
- âœ… Can be monitored with `debug:scheduler`
- âœ… Follows Symfony best practices

#### Verification
```bash
docker compose exec php bin/console debug:scheduler
```

Shows all three schedules:
- `score_tick` - Every 30 seconds
- `weather_collection` - Hourly at :00
- `performance_aggregation` - Daily at 1:00 AM

---

### 2. Timezone Configuration

**Problem**: System was using UTC for all operations, causing confusion with local time displays. Weather observations appeared "Just now" when they were actually from hours ago.

**Solution**: Configured PHP timezone to America/Regina (Saskatoon's timezone).

**Changes Made**:

#### Updated Files
- `docker/php.ini:4` - Changed `date.timezone=UTC` to `date.timezone=America/Regina`

**Impact**:
- All timestamps now display in Saskatoon local time (CST/CDT)
- Scheduled tasks run at expected local times
- Weather observations show accurate local times
- Dashboard displays times users expect to see

#### Verification
```bash
docker compose exec php php -r "echo date_default_timezone_get();"
# Output: America/Regina

docker compose exec php date
# Output: Sun Oct 12 10:35:25 CST 2025
```

---

### 3. Weather Collection Fixes

**Problem 1**: Weather was not updating automatically (hadn't updated in 11 hours)
**Root Cause**: Scheduler wasn't consuming the `scheduler_weather_collection` transport

**Solution**: Added weather collection transport to messenger:consume command

**Problem 2**: Weather banner showed "Just now" for hours-old data
**Root Cause**: Relative time display ("Just now", "5 min ago") was misleading for hourly updates

**Solution**: Changed to absolute timestamps
- Today: Shows time only (e.g., "11:00 PM")
- Yesterday: "Yesterday at 3:00 PM"
- Older: Full date + time (e.g., "Oct 12, 11:00 PM")

**Problem 3**: Banner showed future forecast data as "current"
**Root Cause**: `findLatest()` returned highest timestamp, including forecasts

**Solution**: Added filter in `WeatherObservationRepository::findLatest()`
```php
->where('w.observedAt <= :now')
->setParameter('now', new \DateTimeImmutable())
```

#### Updated Files
- `src/Twig/Components/LiveWeatherBanner.php:142-165` - Absolute timestamp display
- `src/Repository/WeatherObservationRepository.php:26-38` - Filter future observations
- `templates/dashboard/index.html.twig:14-16` - Always render banner (handles null internally)

---

### 4. Enhanced Setup Process

**Problem**: Setup was manual and required multiple commands. No single command to get the application running.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive `make setup` target that does everything.

**Changes Made**:

#### Updated Files
- `Makefile:102-143` - Complete setup automation

**New Targets**:
```makefile
setup:           # Complete application setup (7 steps)
gtfs-load:       # Load GTFS static data
weather-collect: # Collect current weather
```

**What `make setup` Does**:
1. âœ… Build and start Docker containers
2. âœ… Install Composer dependencies
3. âœ… Set up development database
4. âœ… Set up test database
5. âœ… Load GTFS static data (routes, stops, trips)
6. âœ… Collect initial weather data
7. âœ… Run initial score calculation

**Time**: 3-7 minutes on first run

#### Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelwilk/mind-the-wait.git
cd mind-the-wait
make setup
```

---

### 5. Dashboard Improvements

**Problem**: Top performers and needs attention lists were intermittently empty on page refresh.

**Solution**: Improved filtering and sorting logic.

#### Updated Files
- `src/Service/Dashboard/OverviewService.php:227-322`

**Changes**:
- Top performers: Filter by active vehicles AND valid grades, secondary sort by vehicle count
- Needs attention: Target grades D/F and single-vehicle C routes specifically
- More stable across page refreshes

---

## ðŸ”„ Migration Guide

### For Existing Installations

If you have an existing installation, update with:

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 2. Rebuild containers (for timezone change)
docker compose build php scheduler

# 3. Restart scheduler with new configuration
docker compose up -d scheduler

# 4. Verify schedules are running
docker compose exec php bin/console debug:scheduler

# 5. Check logs
docker compose logs -f scheduler
```

### Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backward compatible. Existing installations will continue to work, but won't benefit from:
- Improved scheduler architecture
- Correct timezone display
- Automated weather collection

---

## âœ… Verification Checklist

After updating, verify:

- [ ] All three scheduler tasks appear in `debug:scheduler`
- [ ] Scheduler logs show score tick messages every ~30 seconds
- [ ] Weather collection scheduled for next hour (:00)
- [ ] Timezone shows `America/Regina` in PHP
- [ ] Dashboard displays current weather with local timestamp
- [ ] Top performers/needs attention lists populated
- [ ] `make setup` completes successfully on fresh clone

### Quick Verification

```bash
# Check scheduler is consuming all transports
docker compose logs scheduler | grep "Consuming messages"
# Should show: scheduler_score_tick, scheduler_weather_collection, scheduler_performance_aggregation

# Check score ticks are running
docker compose logs scheduler | tail -20 | grep ScoreTickMessage
# Should show recent messages

# Check timezone
docker compose exec php php -r "echo date_default_timezone_get();"
# Should show: America/Regina

# Check scheduled tasks
docker compose exec php bin/console debug:scheduler
# Should show all three schedules with next run times in -0600 (CST)
```
