## ðŸŽ¯ Major Improvements

### 1. Scheduler Architecture Refactor

**Problem**: The scheduler container was using a bash loop (`while true; do php bin/console app:score:tick; sleep 30; done`), which was a code smell and inconsistent with Symfony best practices.

**Solution**: Migrated to Symfony Scheduler with message-based architecture.

**Changes Made**:

#### New Files
- `src/Scheduler/ScoreTickSchedule.php` - Runs every 30 seconds
- `src/MessageHandler/ScoreTickMessageHandler.php` - Handles score calculation messages

#### Updated Files
- `compose.yaml:97` - Now runs `messenger:consume` instead of bash loop
  ```yaml
  command: php bin/console messenger:consume scheduler_score_tick scheduler_weather_collection scheduler_performance_aggregation -vv
  ```

**Benefits**:
- âœ… Consistent with other scheduled tasks (weather, performance)
- âœ… Proper error handling and retry logic via Messenger
- âœ… Better logging through Symfony's messenger infrastructure
- âœ… Can be monitored with `debug:scheduler`
- âœ… Follows Symfony best practices

#### Verification
```bash
docker compose exec php bin/console debug:scheduler
```

Shows all three schedules:
- `score_tick` - Every 30 seconds
- `weather_collection` - Hourly at :00
- `performance_aggregation` - Daily at 1:00 AM

### 2. Timezone Configuration

**Problem**: System was using UTC for all operations, causing confusion with local time displays. Weather observations appeared "Just now" when they were actually from hours ago.

**Solution**: Configured PHP timezone to America/Regina (Saskatoon's timezone).

**Changes Made**:

#### Updated Files
- `docker/php.ini:4` - Changed `date.timezone=UTC` to `date.timezone=America/Regina`

**Impact**:
- All timestamps now display in Saskatoon local time (CST/CDT)
- Scheduled tasks run at expected local times
- Weather observations show accurate local times
- Dashboard displays times users expect to see

#### Verification
```bash
docker compose exec php php -r "echo date_default_timezone_get();"
# Output: America/Regina

docker compose exec php date
# Output: Sun Oct 12 10:35:25 CST 2025
```

### 3. Weather Collection Fixes

**Problem 1**: Weather was not updating automatically (hadn't updated in 11 hours)
**Root Cause**: Scheduler wasn't consuming the `scheduler_weather_collection` transport

**Solution**: Added weather collection transport to messenger:consume command

**Problem 2**: Weather banner showed "Just now" for hours-old data
**Root Cause**: Relative time display ("Just now", "5 min ago") was misleading for hourly updates

**Solution**: Changed to absolute timestamps
- Today: Shows time only (e.g., "11:00 PM")
- Yesterday: "Yesterday at 3:00 PM"
- Older: Full date + time (e.g., "Oct 12, 11:00 PM")

**Problem 3**: Banner showed future forecast data as "current"
**Root Cause**: `findLatest()` returned highest timestamp, including forecasts

**Solution**: Added filter in `WeatherObservationRepository::findLatest()`
```php
->where('w.observedAt <= :now')
->setParameter('now', new \DateTimeImmutable())
```

#### Updated Files
- `src/Twig/Components/LiveWeatherBanner.php:142-165` - Absolute timestamp display
- `src/Repository/WeatherObservationRepository.php:26-38` - Filter future observations
- `templates/dashboard/index.html.twig:14-16` - Always render banner (handles null internally)

---

### 4. Enhanced Setup Process

**Problem**: Setup was manual and required multiple commands. No single command to get the application running.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive `make setup` target that does everything.

**Changes Made**:

#### Updated Files
- `Makefile:102-143` - Complete setup automation

**New Targets**:
```makefile
setup:           # Complete application setup (7 steps)
gtfs-load:       # Load GTFS static data
weather-collect: # Collect current weather
```

**What `make setup` Does**:
1. âœ… Build and start Docker containers
2. âœ… Install Composer dependencies
3. âœ… Set up development database
4. âœ… Set up test database
5. âœ… Load GTFS static data (routes, stops, trips)
6. âœ… Collect initial weather data
7. âœ… Run initial score calculation

**Time**: 3-7 minutes on first run

#### Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelwilk/mind-the-wait.git
cd mind-the-wait
make setup
```

### 5. Dashboard Improvements

**Problem**: Top performers and needs attention lists were intermittently empty on page refresh.

**Solution**: Improved filtering and sorting logic.

#### Updated Files
- `src/Service/Dashboard/OverviewService.php:227-322`

**Changes**:
- Top performers: Filter by active vehicles AND valid grades, secondary sort by vehicle count
- Needs attention: Target grades D/F and single-vehicle C routes specifically
- More stable across page refreshes

## ðŸ”„ Migration Guide

### For Existing Installations

If you have an existing installation, update with:

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 2. Rebuild containers (for timezone change)
docker compose build php scheduler

# 3. Restart scheduler with new configuration
docker compose up -d scheduler

# 4. Verify schedules are running
docker compose exec php bin/console debug:scheduler

# 5. Check logs
docker compose logs -f scheduler
```

### Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are backward compatible. Existing installations will continue to work, but won't benefit from:
- Improved scheduler architecture
- Correct timezone display
- Automated weather collection

---

## âœ… Verification Checklist

After updating, verify:

- [ ] All three scheduler tasks appear in `debug:scheduler`
- [ ] Scheduler logs show score tick messages every ~30 seconds
- [ ] Weather collection scheduled for next hour (:00)
- [ ] Timezone shows `America/Regina` in PHP
- [ ] Dashboard displays current weather with local timestamp
- [ ] Top performers/needs attention lists populated
- [ ] `make setup` completes successfully on fresh clone

### Quick Verification

```bash
# Check scheduler is consuming all transports
docker compose logs scheduler | grep "Consuming messages"
# Should show: scheduler_score_tick, scheduler_weather_collection, scheduler_performance_aggregation

# Check score ticks are running
docker compose logs scheduler | tail -20 | grep ScoreTickMessage
# Should show recent messages

# Check timezone
docker compose exec php php -r "echo date_default_timezone_get();"
# Should show: America/Regina

# Check scheduled tasks
docker compose exec php bin/console debug:scheduler
# Should show all three schedules with next run times in -0600 (CST)
```
