## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Cost overruns | High | Medium | Set AWS Budget alerts, monitor daily |
| Data loss | Critical | Low | RDS automated backups, test restores |
| Deployment failures | Medium | Medium | Staging environment, rollback workflow |
| GTFS feed downtime | Medium | Medium | Fallback URLs, cached data |
| Security breach | Critical | Low | Security groups, IAM policies, secrets rotation |

### Cost Overrun Prevention

```bash
# Set up AWS Budget
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text) \
  --budget file://budget.json \
  --notifications-with-subscribers file://notifications.json

# budget.json
{
  "BudgetName": "MonthlyECSBudget",
  "BudgetLimit": {
    "Amount": "100",
    "Unit": "USD"
  },
  "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY",
  "BudgetType": "COST"
}

# Monitor daily
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2024-01-01,End=2024-01-31 \
  --granularity DAILY \
  --metrics BlendedCost
```

## Decision Matrix

### Should I deploy to production now?

‚úÖ **Deploy Now If:**
- You have $100-150/month budget
- Need real production data for Phase 5
- Want to learn AWS ECS/Terraform
- Have 2-3 weeks for setup
- Comfortable with cloud operations

‚è∏Ô∏è **Wait If:**
- Budget constrained (<$80/month)
- Not ready for 24/7 uptime responsibility
- Need more development testing
- Prefer simpler deployment (consider DigitalOcean App Platform)

### Alternative: Cost-Optimized VPS

If AWS cost is prohibitive, consider:

**DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **Cost**: $20-40/month (all-inclusive)
- **Pros**: Simpler, cheaper, managed database
- **Cons**: Less scalable, fewer AWS services

**Linode/Hetzner VPS**
- **Cost**: $10-20/month
- **Pros**: Very cheap, full control
- **Cons**: Manual management, docker-compose only

**AWS Lightsail**
- **Cost**: $65-80/month (middle ground)
- **Pros**: Simpler than ECS, still AWS ecosystem
- **Cons**: Less Terraform support, limited features

## Key Terraform Commands

### Daily Operations

```bash
# Plan changes
terraform plan -out=tfplan

# Apply changes
terraform apply tfplan

# View outputs
terraform output -json

# Show current state
terraform show

# Destroy everything (careful!)
terraform destroy  # DANGER: Use only for teardown
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Refresh state
terraform refresh

# Re-import resource
terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0

# View logs
terraform show -json | jq

# Unlock state (if locked)
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID
```

## GitHub Actions Tips

### Triggering Deployments

```bash
# Normal flow: merge release PR
1. Push to main
2. Release Please creates/updates release PR
3. Review changelog
4. Merge release PR ‚Üí Triggers deployment

# Manual deployment
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml

# Rollback
gh workflow run rollback.yml -f version=v1.2.0

# View logs
gh run list
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

### Debugging Failed Deployments

```bash
# Check ECS deployment status
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster mind-the-wait-prod \
  --services mind-the-wait-prod-php \
  --query 'services[0].deployments'

# View task failures
aws ecs describe-tasks \
  --cluster mind-the-wait-prod \
  --tasks <task-arn>

# Check container logs
aws logs tail /ecs/mind-the-wait-prod/php --follow
```

## Emergency Contacts & Runbooks

### Critical Issues

**Service Down (5xx errors)**
1. Check CloudWatch logs for errors
2. Verify ECS tasks are running
3. Check RDS/Redis connectivity
4. Rollback to previous version if needed

**Database Full**
1. Check RDS storage metrics
2. Increase allocated storage (no downtime)
3. Run cleanup: `DELETE FROM arrival_logs WHERE date < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'`

**High Costs**
1. Check Cost Explorer for spike
2. Look for orphaned resources (NAT Gateway, volumes)
3. Reduce ECS task sizes
4. Consider Reserved Instances

**Data Loss**
1. Identify scope (all data vs partial)
2. Restore from RDS snapshot
3. Replay GTFS data load
4. Verify data integrity

## Cost Optimization Checklist

### Month 1
- [ ] Monitor daily costs in AWS Cost Explorer
- [ ] Verify no unexpected charges

- [ ] **Estimated savings**: $8-10/month

### Month 6
- [ ] Consider Fargate Savings Plan (save 20-50%)
- [ ] Evaluate Multi-AZ upgrade ($40 more for HA)
- [ ] Review and tune auto-scaling policies
- [ ] **Estimated savings**: $10-20/month

### Month 12
- [ ] Renew Reserved Instances
- [ ] Evaluate RDS storage (may need 30-40 GB)
- [ ] Consider multi-region backup
- [ ] Review year-over-year cost trends
